            This Project aims at transmitting current from one place to another through
            optical interface and analyze its efficiency by comparing its power loss with
            that of the standard electrical wires for different distance of transmission.

            Movie booking is made simpler with a c++ program. The user has to create
            an account and can use the same to book tickets for the movie. The
            program makes use of hashing and stack algorithms.
